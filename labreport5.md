**What enviorment are you using?**
I am currently on my macbook, using VSCODE, bash, and java files given

**Detail the symptoynm you are seeing. Be specific; include both what you are seeing and what you are supposed to be seeing. Screenshots are ok and so are copy and paste from terminal**
My input for the plaindrome `Level` is a palindrome however instead of my output being true it is giving fasle. My screenshot- [error image] and the bash code [error2 image]

**Detail the failure-inducing input and contect. Place the commands you have run and test cases.**
The input is marked as `Level`. The code is supposed to make a variable for counting the left character which starts and 0 and the rightmost charcater which is the end or str.length()-1, it will use a while loop in order to loop for the code. Left < Right which the loop is checking the characters at the left and right index are not equal. If it does not equate ot will return false, of it is not false it will keep counting until it is false.
